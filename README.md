ðŸŽ§ Spotify Dashboard: Unveiling Insights with Data ðŸŽ¶

Excited to share this Spotify data dashboard I recently created! ðŸŽ‰ Using Power BI, I analyzed over 383 billion streams to uncover key insights into popular music trends. Hereâ€™s a snapshot of what this dashboard reveals:

ðŸ”¹ Top Tracks: "Shape of You" leads with 3.6B streams!
ðŸ”¹ Track Characteristics: Detailed breakdown of danceability, energy, and valence percentages for every track.
ðŸ”¹ Track Trends: Visualizing streams over time, showing a surge in recent years.
ðŸ”¹ Artist Analysis: Popular artists by track, making it easy to spot leading performers.

This dashboard goes beyond just numbersâ€”it offers an in-depth look into the characteristics that make certain tracks successful, from energy to acousticness. Building this was a great exercise in data modeling, interactive visualization, and creating actionable insights from massive datasets.

Itâ€™s always fascinating to see what data reveals about trends, especially in a space as creative and evolving as music! ðŸŽµ
